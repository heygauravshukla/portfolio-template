# Mastering Next.js App Router

The App Router is a game-changer in Next.js 13+, introducing a new paradigm for routing and layouts. Let's explore how to make the most of it.

## Key Features of App Router

1. Nested Layouts
2. Route Groups
3. Loading and Error States
4. Server-First Approach

## File-System Based Routing

The App Router uses a file-system based approach with special files:

- `page.tsx` - Define routes
- `layout.tsx` - Shared layouts
- `loading.tsx` - Loading UI
- `error.tsx` - Error boundaries
- `not-found.tsx` - 404 pages

```jsx
// Example layout.tsx
export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <div className="mx-auto max-w-4xl">
      <nav>{/* Navigation */}</nav>
      {children}
      <footer>{/* Footer */}</footer>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Advanced Patterns

1. Parallel Routes
2. Intercepting Routes
3. Route Groups
4. Dynamic Segments

The App Router brings powerful new capabilities to Next.js applications while maintaining the simplicity developers love.
