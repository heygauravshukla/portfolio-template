# Tailwind CSS Animation Best Practices

Learn how to create smooth, performant animations using Tailwind CSS's built-in animation utilities and custom configurations.

## Built-in Animation Classes

Tailwind provides several animation utilities out of the box:

1. `animate-spin`
2. `animate-ping`
3. `animate-pulse`
4. `animate-bounce`

## Creating Custom Animations

Here's how to extend Tailwind's animation system:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      keyframes: {
        "slide-in": {
          "0%": { transform: "translateX(-100%)" },
          "100%": { transform: "translateX(0)" },
        },
      },
      animation: {
        "slide-in": "slide-in 0.5s ease-out",
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## Performance Tips

1. Use `will-change` appropriately
2. Animate transform and opacity properties
3. Use `@apply` for complex animations
4. Consider reduced-motion preferences

## Common Use Cases

- Page transitions
- Loading states
- Hover effects
- Micro-interactions

Remember: Subtle animations can greatly enhance UX, but too much animation can be distracting.
